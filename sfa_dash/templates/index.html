<p>Welcome to the Solar Forecast Arbiter, a tool for evaluating your
solar power and irradiance forecasts. The Arbiter will allow you to securely
upload forecast data for your own private evaluation, or to participate in
competitive forecast trials that compare forecast performance between
anonymous participantss.</p>

<p>The Arbiter provides a large collection of
<a href="https://solarforecastarbiter.org/referencedata/">reference observations</a>
from several distinct
<a href="https://solarforecastarbiter.org/climatezones/">climate zones</a>
throughout the United States. A suite of
<a href="https://solarforecastarbiter.org/benchmarks/">benchmark forecasts</a>
are provided alongside these reference observations.</p>
