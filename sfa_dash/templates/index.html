<p>Welcome to the Solar Forecast Arbiter, a tool for evaluating your
solar power and irradiance forecasts.</p>
<p>
The Arbiter allows you to:
<ul>
    <li>Securely upload forecast and observation data</li>
    <li>Analyze historical forecast accuracy and track ongoing forecast accuracy</li>
    <li>Optionally share data and analysis reports with other users</li>
    <li>Participate in anonymous, multi-vendor, operational forecast trials</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The Arbiter provides a large collection of
<a href="https://solarforecastarbiter.org/referencedata/">reference observations</a>
from several distinct
<a href="https://solarforecastarbiter.org/climatezones/">climate zones</a>
throughout the United States. A suite of
<a href="https://solarforecastarbiter.org/benchmarks/">benchmark forecasts</a>
are provided alongside these reference observations.</p>

<p>
Returning users can
